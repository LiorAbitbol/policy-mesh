# Context Overview

## Purpose
This folder is the execution alignment contract for humans and AI tools.
It defines scope, rules, and active tasks for the Hybrid AI Control Plane project.

`RULES.md` and `AGENTS.md` in this folder are public pointer documents.
Their canonical versions live in `context/private/`.

This project uses AI-assisted development; detailed operational playbooks are intentionally maintained in private documentation.
Role and session-isolation workflow details are defined in `context/private/AGENTS.md`.
Project directory layout and file placement conventions are documented in `docs/STRUCTURE.md`.

## How To Use
Read in this order:
1. `PROJECT.md`
2. `SCOPE.md`
3. `RULES.md`
4. `TASKS.md`
5. `AGENTS.md`

## Contract
- `SCOPE.md` defines boundaries.
- `RULES.md` points to the canonical non-negotiables in `context/private/RULES.md`.
- `TASKS.md` defines current execution backlog.
- `AGENTS.md` points to the canonical workflow in `context/private/AGENTS.md`.

This is engineering process documentation, not prompt dumping.
