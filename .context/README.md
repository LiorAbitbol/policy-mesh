# Context Overview

## Purpose
This folder is the execution alignment contract for humans and AI tools.
It defines scope, rules, and active tasks for the Policy Mesh project.

`RULES.md` and `AGENTS.md` in this folder are canonical tracked governance docs.
`.context/private/` may include supplemental local/operator notes and task execution records.
Private docs must not override or conflict with canonical tracked docs.

This project uses AI-assisted development. Role and session-isolation workflow details are defined in `.context/AGENTS.md`.
Project directory layout and file placement conventions are documented in `docs/STRUCTURE.md`.

## How To Use
Read in this order:
1. `PROJECT.md` — quick pointer to product and current state
2. `SCOPE.md` — in/out of scope and boundaries
3. `RULES.md` — engineering guardrails
4. `TASKS.md` — backlog and status
5. `AGENTS.md` — role model and workflow

## Contract
- `SCOPE.md` defines boundaries.
- `RULES.md` defines canonical non-negotiable engineering guardrails.
- `TASKS.md` defines current execution backlog.
- `AGENTS.md` defines canonical role boundaries and workflow.

This is engineering process documentation, not prompt dumping.
